# Rock Scissors Paper with Tkinter

Ahoy! As a beginner in the Python and general programming world, I have decided to navigate on the "mysterious seas of Github", pushing my first public project. Instead of walking again in simple five-line scripts, I've challenged myself to embark on something a bit more complex. The popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors," known in Brazil as "Pedra, Papel, Tesoura," seemed like an interesting choice. However, I didn't want to create just another terminal-based game. PyGame crossed my mind, but I find Tkinter interfaces naturally so charming and nostalgic! That's why I've opted for Tkinter. My design is minimalist, and the game alternates between images and texts, but could be creepy... OH, about the mechanic of the game! Is simple: ever the player starts the game and choose among scissors, paper or rock, the random chose of the computer is revealed, and the winner is declareted as well.
